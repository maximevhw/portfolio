I recently rebuilt my personal website using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and now host it on GitHub Pages. After experimenting with various self-hosted options in the past, I wanted something simpler, faster, and easier to manage. Docusaurus turned out to be the perfect fit.

## Why Docusaurus?

- 🧱 **Markdown-first**: I can write everything in plain Markdown, which keeps things lightweight and clean.  
- 🚀 **Blazing fast**: Static site = instant load times and no backend overhead.  
- 🔧 **Fully customizable**: React-based theming and plugin system give me room to grow.  
- 🌍 **Version control**: Everything is stored and tracked in Git.  

## Deployment with GitHub Pages

I host the site for free via GitHub Pages, with automatic deployment on every push using GitHub actions.  
No server to maintain, no security patching. Just clean builds and instant updates.

## What About My Old Setup?

I’ve run my own infrastructure using Proxmox and Debian-based VMs on an HPE DL380p for a while now. That experience taught me a lot about self-hosting and managing web traffic through Cloudflare tunnels.  
But for my blog, I now prefer a setup that lets me focus on content, not maintenance.

If you're looking for a developer-friendly static site generator, [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is definitely worth trying.
