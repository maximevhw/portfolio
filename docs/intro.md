# 🧠 Maxime’s Knowledge Base

Welcome to my personal knowledge base, a collection of notes, ideas, and practical examples from across the IT and cybersecurity landscape.

This isn't meant to be a formal guide or textbook. It's a **second brain**:  
A place to **store**, **refine**, and **connect** knowledge I’ve gained through study, work, and hands-on experience.

## 🗂️ What You'll Find Here

  Real-world tactics, bypasses, shell tricks, and post-exploitation techniques.

- **Blue Teaming & Detection**  
  Notes on log analysis, hardening, and defensive measures.

- **General IT Knowledge**  
  Useful how-tos, sysadmin notes, scripting shortcuts, and troubleshooting steps.

- **Windows & Linux Internals**  
  Deep dives into OS behavior, permissions, and system interactions.

- **Tools & Scripts**  
  Handy one-liners, automation snippets, and script references.

## 🎯 Why This Exists

This documentation isn't perfect — and that's okay.  
It was never meant to be.  
Primarily, I built this to help **myself**: to keep track of things I’ve learned, solved, or want to revisit later.

But I decided to make it public, because **you never know**. Maybe someone else will stumble across one of these notes and find something useful.  
If that’s you: glad it helped!
